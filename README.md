# Beef Programming Language

Beef Language

Beef is an open source performance-oriented compiled programming language which has been built hand-in-hand with its IDE environment.

The Beef Development Tools include an IDE with a general-purpose debugger capable of debugging native applications written in any language.

The IDE supports productivity features such as autocomplete, fixits, reformatting, refactoring tools, type inspection, hot compilation, and a built-in profiler.

Beef allows for safely mixing different optimization levels on a per-type or per-method level, allowing for performance-critical code to be executed at maximum speed without affecting debuggability of the rest of the application.

Beef can detect memory leaks in real-time. As with most safety features in Beef, this can be turned off in Release builds for performance-critical applications.
